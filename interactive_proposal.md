## Interactive Visualization Proposal - Nursing Home Inspections US Map

**Nadia Ghazali**

Nursing home inspections play a critical role in publicly-available facility quality measures. In 1998, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released Nursing Home Compare, a 5-star rating system for every nursing home in the US. These ratings are calculated from nursing home inspections, staffing measures, and largely self-reported clinical measures. Nursing home inspections contribute the largest proportion of this rating, but there is concern over the validity of this data. Due to flatlined federal funding, state survey agencies have struggled to hire and keep enough surveyors to conduct surveys on schedule. And while CMS has provided rigid guidelines for the state inspection process, there are inconsistencies in deficiency counts between otherwise similar states. 

For my interactive visualization, I will expand upon my static visualization. I will create an interactive US map of nursing homes with facility level information about deficiencies, fines, and overdue surveys. I also want to provide options on how the facility dots will be colored (five star rating, amount of fines, overdue survey status). 

## Example Visualizations

Core Interactive: Very similar to my goal. Here, each dot would represent a facility and hovering over a dot would provide additional information about the facility.

Core Interactive: This is a map of nursing facilities with additional facility level information. I hope to incorporate a filter option like this map does.

### Potential Data Sources
-------------------------------
**Provider Information** (14,817 rows/102 columns)
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py

* This dataset contains information about currently active nursing homes, including their geographic location, number of certified beds, number of average residents, quality ratings, and survey dates, and deficiencies. Each row represents a nursing home. 

**Health Deficiencies** (401,509 rows/22 columns)
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/r5ix-sfxw

* This dataset contains information about nursing home deficiencies over the past three years, including the nursing home, inspection date, citation number, scope and severity, and date of correction. Each row represents a deficiency.

Table 1. Nursing Homes, Certified Beds, and Surveyor Positions, by State FY2022 (52 rows, 5 columns)
* This table contains state level information on the number of surveyor positions, the number of nursing homes per surveyor position, and the number of nursing home beds per surveyor position. Each row represents a state. 

Table 2: Percent of Vacant Surveyor Positions, by State, 2002 and 2022 (52 rows, 2 columns)
* This table contains state level information on the percentage of vacant surveyor positions by state. Each row represents a state.



## Questions 
----------------------------
* Is my map too similar to the already existing nursing facility map (example 2?)
